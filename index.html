<p>What's Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD)?</p>

<p><cite>"In computational linguistics, word-sense disambiguation (WSD) is an open problem of natural language processing and ontology. WSD is identifying which sense of a word (i.e. meaning) is used in a sentence, when the word has multiple meanings. 
The solution to this problem impacts other computer-related writing, such as discourse, improving relevance of search engines, anaphora resolution, coherence, inference et cetera."</cite> --cited from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word-sense_disambiguation">wikipedia</a>.<p>

<p>What's K-means algorithm?</p>

</p><cite>"K-means clustering is a method of vector quantization, originally from signal processing, that is popular for cluster analysis in data mining. k-means clustering aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean,
serving as a prototype of the cluster. This results in a partitioning of the data space into Voronoi cells."</cite> --also cited from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering">wikipedia</a>.</p>

<p>This improved K-means algorithm achieves the clustering of word sense sample for future disambiguation. The traditional K-means algorithm has a O(NKTD) time complexity where N is the number of samplings, K is the number of clustering center, T is the number of iterations, and D is the dimension of the sampling vector.</p>

<p>We improve this algorithm in the following aspects:</p>

<p>First, we improve the selection of the initial clustering centers. In the traditional version, the intial centers are selected ramdonly. However, K-means algorithm is strongly influence by the intial centers. Intial centers selected by random may lead to bad results. In this improved version, the intial points are selected by a max-min distance algorithm, to fastly and efficiently get the best intial points.

<p>Second, the cluster centers are updated every time after the iteration is finished, where in this improved version, the clusters are updated once a new sample is included, which enhance the astringency of the algorithm.

<p>Third, in order to achieve the goal of "minimize the variance in clusters, maximize the varince between clusters", also taking the consideration that the intial K value, the clustering number, may not be the optimal, we build a mechanism to optimize the k value. When two clustering centers are too closed, we combine them. When the variance of a clustering is too large, we split it.
